## The Zygur Vision

Zygur becomes the company that developers trust for their marketing automation needs. Just as developers have preferred tools for coding (VS Code), version control (Git), and deployment (Vercel), Zygur's Kasey AI becomes the default choice for developer marketing automation.

**Mission:** Make marketing accessible to every developer through intelligent automation that respects their workflow.

**Vision:** A world where great developer products don't fail due to poor marketing.
