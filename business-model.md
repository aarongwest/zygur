# Zygur Business Model

## Overview

**Zygur** is an **AI-powered digital agency**.

Primary message on-site: **Hire us or rent our digital factory to grow and/or manage your business.**

Top-level offer structure:
- **Done for You** (Digital Services)
- **Do it Yourself** (Digital Factory)

**SciCo.ai** is an AI-powered digital factory. It's the system we use to identify, validate, build, market, and ship products at unprecedented speed. Six AI agents handle every business function — strategy, product, marketing, customer success, revenue, and compliance — enabling true solo operation at scale.

---

## The Core Strategy

### The Product Factory Model

We don't build one product. We ship **multiple products per month** across different verticals. Each product:
- Targets a specific customer segment
- Solves a validated painful problem
- Has its own marketing and distribution
- Mix of one-time purchases and subscriptions

### Volume Game with Quality Execution

- **Week 1-4:** Ship Knucks.ai (marketing agent) fully
- **Week 5-16:** Ship 1 product per week (CLI tools, iOS apps, SaaS)
- **Month 4+:** Double down on winners, kill losers
- **Month 6-12:** Complete the full AI agent org

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### For SciCo.ai
1. **Dogfood everything** - Use agents for our own products first
2. **Ship Knucks.ai website** - Get TikTok API approval
3. **Package for external sale** - Launch Knucks publicly
4. **Add agents incrementally** - Ship one agent every 4-6 weeks
5. **Bundle pricing** - Sell full org as premium offering

### For Individual Products
- **Twitter/X posts** - Primary distribution channel
- **Marketplace listings** - App Store, Product Hunt, etc.
- **Knucks handles marketing** - Automated content generation
- **Ship and validate** - Fast iteration, kill losers, scale winners

## Competitive Advantages

### 1. Speed
With AI agents, we compress product development from months to weeks. We can test 10 ideas in the time competitors test 1.

### 2. Multiple Bets
We're not betting everything on one product. Portfolio approach increases chances of hitting 20k MRR.

### 3. The Factory IS the Moat
The AI-powered digital factory is the competitive advantage. While competitors struggle to ship one product, we ship ten. The system itself becomes more valuable than any individual product. Eventually, SciCo.ai (the factory) becomes the sellable product.

### 4. Solo Operation
No employees = no overhead. One founder + AI agents = maximum leverage.

---

## Success Metrics

### Year 1 Goals
- $20,000 MRR (primary goal)
- 10-15 products shipped
- 3-5 products showing traction
- 100-500 paying customers across all products
- Knucks.ai fully operational and generating revenue

### Path to $1M ARR (Year 2)
- $83,000 MRR
- Scale winning products
- Full SciCo.ai agent org operational
- 1,000+ paying customers
- Potential acquisition interest in SciCo.ai system itself

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Shipping too fast, quality suffers | Focus on simple products with low support burden |
| Support overwhelm | Build products that don't break, ruthlessly kill support-heavy products |
| Scattered focus | Kill losers fast, double down on winners after 12 weeks |
| LLM API costs | Multi-provider support, optimize prompts, charge enough to cover costs |
| Market saturation | Agents help us pivot quickly to new opportunities |

---

## Why This Works

1. **Solves my own problems first** - Knucks automates marketing I hate doing
2. **Immediate validation** - Using it for my own products + current client
3. **Terminal-native** - Aligns with my skills and interests
4. **Portfolio approach** - Multiple shots on goal for 20k MRR
5. **Incremental shipping** - Don't need to build everything at once
6. **Agents reduce friction** - Makes solo operation viable at scale

---

## The Zygur Structure

**Zygur.com** = Parent company / indie software studio
- Portfolio site showcasing SciCo.ai
- Services section (marketing, development, strategy)
- No disclosure of individual product portfolio
- Only promoted when seeking new client work

**SciCo.ai** = The AI-powered digital factory
- Separate branding and website
- Primary product offering
- Can be sold as individual agents or full factory

**Individual Products** = Each gets its own domain/site
- knucks.ai
- kasey.ai (if sold separately)
- [product-name].com for each shipped product
- Independent marketing and positioning

---

## Next 90 Days

**Weeks 1-4: Complete Knucks**
1. Ship knucks.ai website
2. Get TikTok API approval
3. Add auto-posting capability
4. Use for all existing products
5. Package for external customers

**Weeks 5-8: Ship 4 Products**
- 1 product per week
- Knucks handles marketing
- List on marketplaces
- Validate revenue potential

**Weeks 9-12: Ship 4 More Products**
- Continue weekly shipping cadence
- Monitor traction metrics
- Kill products with no traction
- Scale winners

**Month 4: Strategic Review**
- Identify the 2-3 products showing traction
- Decision: Scale those OR focus on SciCo.ai agents
- Begin building next agent (Kasey or Khristyn)

---

## The End Game

**Option A: Portfolio Exit**
Build multiple profitable products, sell the portfolio to a holding company or PE firm. SciCo.ai becomes the operational blueprint.

**Option B: SciCo.ai Exit**
The agent system itself becomes the main product. License or sell it to other indie hackers who want to ship fast.

**Option C: Lifestyle Business**
Hit $1M ARR, run it solo indefinitely, keep shipping products that interest me.

All options are viable. The strategy supports any of these outcomes.
